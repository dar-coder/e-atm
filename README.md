# e-atm
# A Python ATM project (OOP)
# created by dar-coder

This is a program which simulates an ATM machine that first prompts the user whether he/she wants to register or sign in. After the user registers/signs in, the program than prompts him to chose an option:
1) See user information
2) Balance check
3) Deposit money
4) Withdraw money
5) Change pin code
6) Exit

The information about each user is saved in a .txt file which is named {username}.txt. The program creates a .txt file for each user separately.

The project consists of 3 files:
1) user.py - a file in which the User class is defined
2) helpers.py - a file in which the register and the login functions are defined
3) application.py - a file in which the main() funstion is defined.

In order to run the project, navigate to the directory of the project and run the application.py file.
